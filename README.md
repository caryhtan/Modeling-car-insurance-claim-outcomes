# Modeling Car Insurance Claim Outcomes
![car](car.jpg)

Machine learning is very popular in the insurance market, which has long been renowned for being data-driven. Working on behalf of On the Road car insurance, I explored their publicly accessible dataset (car_insurance.csv) to investigate customer data and identify the single feature that produces the most accurate logistic regression model for predicting whether a claim will be made against a policy. Using this dataset and its feature descriptions, I trained logistic regression models for each feature, evaluated their performance, and identified the most predictive feature to guide future efforts.
